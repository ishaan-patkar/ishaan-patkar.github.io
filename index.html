        <h2>Expository Papers</h2>

        A collection of expository papers in mathematics that I've written. Some are considerably more polished than the others.<br/><br/>

        The following three papers were written for Honors Multivariable Calculus (Math H53) at UC Berkeley. As such, the papers are written for students who have not necessarily seen analysis before.

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="./res/An Introduction to the Metric Topology of Rn.pdf">An Introduction to the Metric Topology of R^n.</a> 2022. </li>

            <li> <a href="./res/An Introduction to Probability Theory.pdf">An Introduction to Probability Theory.</a> 2022.</li>

            <li> <a href="./res/Limit Rules in Rn.pdf">Limit Rules in R^n.</a> 2022.</li>
        </ul>

        The next three papers were written at <a href="https://eulercircle.com">Euler Circle</a>, a mathematics institute run by <a href="http://simonrs.com">Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo</a> offering college-level math courses for high school students. These papers were written with mathematics students in mind.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./res/Catalan Numbers.pdf">Catalan Numbers.</a> For Combinatorics at Euler Circle. 2021.</li>
            
            <li> <a href="./res/An Axiomatic Introduction to Formal Probability Theory.pdf">An Axiomatic Introduction to Formal Probability Theory.</a> For Markov Chains at Euler Circle. 2020.</li>

            <li><a href="./res/Free Groups and Presentations.pdf">Free Groups and Presentations.</a> For Abstract Algebra at Euler Circle. 2020.</li>
        </ul>

        Finally, a paper I worked on for the precalculus class at my high school. This was my first serious attempt at mathematical writing.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./res/Random Number Generators.pdf">Random Number Generators.</a> For precalculus at Henry M. Gunn High School. 2020. With Tong Miao.</li>
        </ul>
